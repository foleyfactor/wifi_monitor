# Wifi Monitor

We're having some speed issues with our Wifi at our AirBnb, so we're keeping
a log of the internet speed over the course of the days.

## TODO:
 * Write a quick and dirty js script to display the data (longterm move to graphite)
 * Setup the cron job on Weiwei's computer so that we get a good stream of data
 * Make things cleaner (stop using commits to upload data!!!)
 * E X T E N S I B I L I T Y

We should probably also have a ping functionality that just verifies that the Wifi is up by hitting a webpage.
